# MARBLE AWS CDK Prototype

This is a prototype automated build and deployment orchestration for the MARBLE infrastructure developed by Ian Alford (ialford@nd.edu) based on the Amazon AWS Typescript CDK. Using the CDK you can both deploy the infrastructure and application code, as well as emit CloudFormation that can be used for orchestration purposes.

**To prep the dev environment**:

- `npm install -g aws-cdk`
- `npm install -g typescript`
- `cd ./deploy/manifest`
- `npm install`
